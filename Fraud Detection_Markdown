# Fraud Detection — <project-name>


**Problem statement:** Identify fraudulent transactions in real time to reduce chargebacks and customer friction.


**Primary metric:** Precision at recall X (e.g., Precision@0.8 recall), or Precision@K, AUC-ROC as secondary.


**Data sources:**
- Transaction logs (DB: transactions)
- User account metadata
- Historical chargebacks/fraud labels
- Third-party signals (IP reputation, device fingerprinting)


**Validation:** Time-based split (train up to T, validate from T to T+window, test on most recent period). Use nested CV for model selection if non-temporal features only.


**Baseline model:** Logistic regression with class weighting + simple rule-based filters.


**Deployment:** Low-latency scoring endpoint (≤ 50ms) + batch scoring for nightly investigations.
