# Time-Series Forecasting — <project-name>


**Problem statement:** Forecast metric X (demand/sales/CPU load) at horizon H (e.g., 1 day / 1 hour / 12 weeks) to support planning.


**Primary metric:** MAPE / sMAPE / MAE / RMSE depending on scale and business tolerance.


**Data sources:**
- Historical time series (transaction counts, sales) with timestamps
- Calendar features (holidays, promotions)
- Exogenous features: weather, price, marketing spend


**Validation:** Rolling-origin (time series cross-validation) with gap to avoid leakage.


**Baseline:** Naive (last period), seasonal naïve, or simple ETS/ARIMA.
